- What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
         Hardware Layer: This is the lowest layer of a computer system and includes all the physical components such as the CPU, memory, input/output devices, and buses. It deals with the actual electronic and mechanical aspects of the computer's operation. Operating System Layer: This layer sits on top of the hardware layer and provides an interface between the hardware and the higher     level software. It manages system resources, provides services to application programs, and controls hardware operations.
- What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
        The three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture are: Fetch: The processor fetches the next instruction from memory, Decode: The processor decodes the fetched instruction to determine what operation it should perform and on which data, and Execute: The processor executes the decoded instructions.
- What is the purpose of an ALU?
        The purpose of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is to perform arithmetic and logical operations on data. It's a crucial component of the CPU responsible for tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise operations, and comparisons. https://www.britannica.com/technology/arithmetic     logic     unit 
- What is a register?
        A register is a small, high     speed storage location within the CPU that is used to store temporary data, operands, and addresses..
- What is one difference between Application software and System software?
        Application Software: This software is designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end     users. It includes programs like word processors, web browsers, games, and productivity software. System Software: System software, on the other hand, manages and controls the hardware and provides a platform for running application software. It includes the operating system, device drivers, utility programs, and compilers.

To convert from hex to decimal, you can use the following formula:
Decimal = (F * 16^3) + (A * 16^2) + (C * 16^1) + (3 * 16^0)
Decimal = (15 * 4096) + (10 * 256) + (12 * 16) + (3 * 1)
Decimal = 61440 + 2560 + 192 + 3
Decimal = 63895
So, Hex FAC3 as an unsigned decimal is: 63895

3. Hex FAC3 as a signed decimal:
First, convert FAC3 to its 16-bit binary form: 1111101011000011.
In two's complement, the most significant bit (leftmost) is the sign bit. If it's 1, the number is negative.
The sign bit is 1, so it's a negative number.
Invert all bits: 0000010100111100
Add 1 to the inverted value: 0000010100111101
Decimal = -(2^15) + (2^2) + (2^1) + (2^0)
Decimal = -32768 + 4 + 2 + 1
Decimal = -32761

So, Hex FAC3 as a signed decimal is: -32761

Decimal = 0 + 0 + 6
Decimal = 6

So, Hex 0064 as an unsigned decimal is: 6

6. Hex 0064 as a signed decimal:
Treat 0064 as a signed 16-bit number, it remains positive:

0 = 0000
0 = 0000
0 = 0000
So, Hex 8000 in binary is: 1000000000000000

8. Hex 8000 as an unsigned decimal:
To convert from hex to decimal, you can use the following formula:
Decimal = (8 * 16^3) + (0 * 16^2) + (0 * 16^1) + (0 * 16^0)
Decimal = (8 * 4096) + (0 * 256) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 1)
Decimal = 32768 + 0 + 0 + 0
Decimal = 32768

9. So, Hex 8000 as an unsigned decimal is: 32768

Hex 8000 as a signed decimal:
If we treat 8000 as a signed 16-bit number, it's a negative number in two's complement form.
First, convert 8000 to its 16-bit binary form: 1000000000000000.
The sign bit is 1, so it's a negative number.
Invert all bits: 0111111111111111
Add 1 to the inverted value: 1000000000000000
Decimal = -(2^15)
Decimal = -32768

So, Hex 8000 as a signed decimal is: -32768
